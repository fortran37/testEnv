This module has only been tested on NT platforms. 
Actually only Windows 10.
In fact, that's all it's written for.
One day it will be platform-independent! (maybe)

Anyway, I'm slowly amassing functions I like to use during design and testing while I become fluent in Python.

This repository is mostly to show my progress (and back up my work remotely.)
